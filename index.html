                <b><a href="tetris/tetris_EN.html">Leftris</a></b>:<br>
                Online Tetris game that can be played with the pieces falling upwards or to the left (or optionally with
                surprise changes of gameplay direction).<br>
                Check out the effects after you wipe out several lines at a time or try playing on a grid of a different
                size.<br>
                Not mobile device friendly (Needs a keyboard).<br><br><br>
                <b><a href="risar/sorta-paint_EN.html">Sorta paint</a></b>:<br>
                A rudimentary program for drawing, a test polygon when I was learning how to work with stuff on the
                screen.<br>
                Some parts of the interface might be in Slovenian (no other reason than that is my mother language and
                was the working language when doing the UI).<br><br><br>
                <b><a href="klasifikator/index.html">Classifier neural network</a></b>:<br>
                An attempt to a classifier neural network that classifies Slovene names by gender. Not a serious product
                and definitely no claims about the results, just a program with which I was learning to create and train
                a neural network. UI in Slovene only and has been trained on Slovene names only.<br><br><br>

                <b>The why behind name "byGuesswork"</b><br>
                When learning to code, the journey was sometimes smooth sailing, sometimes going nowhere for sessions,
                sometimes bouncing me from one head-scratching puzzle into the next. Probably the usual when you throw
                yourself into something completely new. In the midst of it, I often got aware of a feeling, or a
                thought, that the way things moved forward was by guesswork (not really of the lost, but of the
                curious kind).<br>
                A most enjoyable learning adventure. (It still is.)
                <!-- When learning to code, the going took me on a path that was sometimes slithering, sometimes
                    moshing from a head-scratching puzzle into the next. Probably very usual for when you throw
                    yourself into something completely new. Through it all, I often got aware that the current moment
                    evoked a feeling, or thought, of wayfinding by guesswork (of the curious kind). -->
                <!-- When learning to code, the path I ended up going by was an endless string of hiccups and stumbling
                    from one head-scratcher to the next, quite often evoking a feeling of wayfinding by guesswork
                    (of the curious kind). -->
                <!-- When starting to code and later on, when learning took place in the form of an endless string of
                    hiccups, roadblocks and stumbling from one head-scratcher into the next, the general direction
                    things were going often felt akin to progressing by guesswork (and hope).
                    Enjoyed it all thoroughly. Actually, I still do. -->
