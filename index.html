            Two programs I wrote to learn about JavaScript and HTML.<br><br>
            <b>Tetris</b>:<br>
            does not like mobile and is not really a friend of a too small screen<br>
            Try out playing in different directions (or in random direction mode) or wiping out several lines at a
            time<br><br>
            <b>Sorta paint</b>:<br>
            currently only in Slovenian (no other reason than that is my mother
            language)<br><br>
            Why byguesswork? Because the learning was nothing but a mix of guesswork with trial and error with a bit
            of<br>
            determination and direction. Enjoyed the whole of it!
