            Two programs I wrote since I started to learn JavaScript and HTML as a hobby.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Tetris</b>:<br>
            Try out playing Tetris in various directions (or in random mode, with surprise gameplay direction
            changes).<br>
            Check out the effects after you wipe out several lines at a time or try playing on a grid of a different
            size.<br>
            Not mobile device friendly (Needs a keyboard).<br><br><br>
            <b>Sorta paint</b>:<br>
            A rudimentary program for drawing (it was my test polygon when learning how to manipulate stuff on the
            screen).<br>
            Some parts of the interface might be in Slovenian (no other reason than that is my mother
            language and so far I haven't managed to localize all parts yet)<br><br>
            Why "By guesswork"? Because when working on the programs, the process felt like a mix of
            guesswork, trial and error style, regular course correction and learning as you go. Enjoyed the whole of it!
