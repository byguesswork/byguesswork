            Two programs I wrote since I started to learn JavaScript and HTML.<br><br>
            <b>Tetris</b>:<br>
            Try out playing Tetris in different directions (or in random direction mode) or wiping out several lines at
            a time.<br>
            Does not like mobile and is not really a friend of a screen that is too small<br><br>
            <b>Sorta paint</b>:<br>
            A rudimentary program for drawing. (Actually a test polygon to learn about manipulating stuff on the
            screen.)<br>
            Currently only in Slovenian (no other reason than that is my mother
            language)<br><br>
            Why "By guesswork"? Because the learning was nothing but a mix of guesswork, trial and error style, with<br>
            a side of determination (plus obviously the irreplacable main dish in the form of a great online JS
            course).<br>
            Enjoyed the whole of it!
