            Two programs I wrote since I started to learn JavaScript and HTML as a hobby.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Tetris</b>:<br>
            Try out playing Tetris in different directions (or in random direction mode) or wiping out several lines at
            a time<br><br>
            <b>Sorta paint</b>:<br>
            A rudimentary program for drawing (it was my test polygon when learning how to manipulate stuff on the
            screen).<br>
            Currently only in Slovenian (no other reason than that is my mother
            language)<br><br>
            Why "By guesswork"? Because when working on the programs, the process felt like a mix of
            guesswork,<br>
            trial and error style, regular course correction and learning as you go. Enjoyed the whole of it!
