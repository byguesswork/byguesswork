        <h1>Fuel (android app)<br>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: August 3, 2023</p>
        <p> This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your
            information when You use the App and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.</p>

        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>App</strong> means the software program named <strong>Fuel</strong>
                    provided by the Company and downloaded by You from
                    Google Play and installed onto a Device.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Company</strong> (referred to as either &quot;the Company&quot;, &quot;We&quot;,
                    &quot;Us&quot; or &quot;Our&quot; in this Agreement) refers to App.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Device</strong> means any Device on which the App can be installed and run, such as a
                    smartphone or a digital tablet.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Personal Data</strong> is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable
                    individual.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>You</strong> (referred to also as &quot;User&quot;) means the individual using
                    the App.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1> Information About Your Personal Data and Other Types of Data </h1><br>
        <h3>Personal Data</h3>
        <p>We do not collect, store, use or disclose Your Personal data in any way nor do any third parties
            collect, store, use or disclose any data for Our behalf.</p>


        <p>The use of the App does not require the User to register or sign up for any service or authenticate
            themselves in any way.</p>


        <p> The App does not require access to any information on your Device such as Location, Personal Info,
            Financial info, Contacts List, Health and Fitness, Messages, Photos and video, Audio files, Camera,
            Files, Calendar or Device Id and does not gather any info on App activity and App performance
            (diagnostics).</p>


        <p> The App offers internet browsing capability but solely for the purpose to visit this Privacy Policy
            site. No records are gathered or kept about websites You might visit during the in-app web browsing
            session. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or
            practices of any third party sites that You might visit during an in-app browsing session.</p>
        <h3> Other types of Data than Personal Data </h3>
        <p> The only data that the App stores on User's Device is data needed for the functioning of the App itself. The
            App is a fuel consumption tracker and therefore needs data about fuel ups in order to calculate consumption.
            Such data is entered manually by the User and stored locally on User's Device and is never transmitted
            outside of it. The User can choose to delete these data within the Device at any time.
        </p>
        <p> The only data that might be transferred outside the User's Device is data that might be generated and
            subsequently transferred from the Device by the Google Play ecosystem/infrastructure, ie. data
            related to eventual App crash reports, errors in App functioning and similar. The App itself does
            not generate, collect, use or transmit such data.</p>
        <p> We do not use tracking tools.<br>
            We do not collect User email addresses and do not send out emails to
            Users.
        </p>
