        <h1>Fuel consumption tracker android app (available on Google Play Store)</h1>

        <p>I am probably an obsessed fuel consumption tracker - been tracking the consumption of cars I owned (one at a time) for the better 
            part of the last 10 years and perhaps missed a couple of fuel ups during this whole time. Nerdy. Started with a spreadsheet on 
            the PC then went to a cloud solution on mobile. Then on one occassion I fumbled with the synchronization and lost the data for 
            one fuel up. Aargh! So I thought, what if I make a simple tracker app for personal use on my mobile phone. OK, perhaps not so 
            useful as countless other things out there, but definitely a decent challenge for a hobbyist.</p>

        <p>After a couple of months work on it I use it now as my primary tool for keeping up with this obsession of tracking fuel ups (OK, 
            still copy data to a spreadsheet, just in case). So I thought to add a bit of features to perhaps make it more usable for 
            potential other users as well (like conversion of units or possibility to track data for several cars) and put it on Google 
            Play. So here it is, a basic homemade fuel consumption tracker app:</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> App currently has status "In development" (or something similar) on Google Play but nonetheless it is fully
            functional, nothing's lacking, nothing's wrong, it is just a status in the lifecycle of an app (I am by no means a pro developer 
            and haven't yet managed to get it to production mode)</p>

        <br>
        <p>App characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;A handy app where to quickly log fuel ups on the go</li>
            <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreadsheet with clear overview of fuel consumption and costs</li>
            <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple to use</li>
            <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Requires no sign up or login</li>
            <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;No ads, free</li>
        </ul>
