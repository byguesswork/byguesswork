                <p><strong>Company</strong> (referred to as either &quot;the Company&quot;, &quot;We&quot;,

                <p><strong>Device</strong> means any Device on which the App can be installed and run, such as a
                    smartphone or a
                    digital tablet.</p>

                <p><strong>Personal Data</strong> is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable
                    individual.</p>

        <h1> Information About Your Personal Data and Other Types of Data </h1><br>
        <h3>Personal Data</h3>
        <p>We do not collect, store, use or disclose Your Personal data in any way nor do any third parties
            collect, store, use or disclose any data for Our behalf.</p>


        <p>The use of the App does not require the User to register or sign up for any service or authenticate
            themselves in any way.</p>


        <p> The App does not require access to any information on your Device such as Location, Personal Info,
            Financial info, Contacts List, Health and Fitness, Messages, Photos and video, Audio files, Camera,
            Files, Calendar or Device Id and does not gather any info on App activity and App performance
            (diagnostics).</p>


        <p> The App offers internet browsing capability but solely for the purpose to visit this Privacy Policy
            site. No records are gathered or kept about websites You might visit during the in-app web browsing
            session. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or
            practices of any third party sites that You might visit during an in-app browsing session.</p>
        <h3> Other types of Data than Personal Data </h3>
        <p> The only data that the App stores on User's Device is data needed for the functioning of some of the
            functions of the App that the User knowingly and willingly uses via the App's
            user interface (ie. the Favorite items and Recent items lists of items that are available within the App).
            The User can choose to delete these data within the Device at any time.</p>
        <p> The only data that might be transferred outside the User's Device is data that might be generated and
            subsequently transferred from the Device by the Google Play ecosystem/infrastructure, ie. data
            related to eventual App crash reports, errors in App functioning and similar. The App itself does
            not generate, collect, use or transmit such data.</p>
        <p> We do not use tracking tools. We do not collect User email addresses and do not send out emails to
            Users.</p>
        <h1>Children's Privacy</h1>
        <p> While the App is also directed to children, it does not collect, store, use or disclose any data from
            children under 13.</p>
        <h1>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p> We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy on this web page.</p>
        <p> You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy
            Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
