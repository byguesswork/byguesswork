        <h3>Personal Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>We do not collect, store, use or disclose Your Personal data in any way nor do any third parties
                    collect, store, use or disclose any data for Our behalf.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The use of the App does not require the User to register or sign up for any service or authenticate
                    themselves in any way.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> The App does not require access to any information from the Device such as Location, Personal Info,

                    Files, Calendar or Device Id and does not gather any info on App activity and App performance

                    session. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or
                    practices of any third party sites that You might visit during an in-app browsing session.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Other types of Data than Personal Data </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> The only data that the App stores on User's Device is data needed for the functioning of some of the
                    functions that form part of the App and that the User knowingly and willingly uses via the App's
                    user interface (ie. the Favorite items and Recent items lists of items, that are available within the App ). The User can choose to
                    delete this data within the Device at any time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> The only data that might be transfered outside the User's Device is data that might be generated and
                    subsequently transferred from the Device by the Google Play ecosystem/infrastructure, ie. data
                    related to eventual App crash reports, errors in App functioning and similar. The App itself does
                    not generate, collect, use or transmit such data.</p>
