            can't think of a suitable one?<br>

        <p>There&apos;s no shortage of reasons why engaging in play is beneficial. Play is playful. Play is
            exploration,
            experimentation, testing. Play is creativity. Play teaches you to be attentive, to connect with own senses,
            feelings and intentions. Play is playful gathering of experiences and skills that will be important later in
            life.</p>

        <p>Play is socializing. With play we learn how to understand others, deal with own emotions and those of
            others, how to behave in a social context, how to resolve disputes. Play is learning how to cooperate with
            others. Play is learning how to work together towards a common goal. Play is learning how to get around a
            shared vision and work out a strategy for bringing it to life.</p>

        <p>Play is experiencing the joy and pleasure of a win. Play is learning how to cope with a loss. Play is
            learning how rules and instructions work and how to work with them. Play is discovering how it feels to come
            up with own rules to adapt existing games or come up with new ones. Play is the joy of unabridged
            imagination let loose to savor the world one finds themselves in. Play is the ultimate playground for
            imagination and brings happiness and joy to body, mind and soul.</p>
