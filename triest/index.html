                Two programs I wrote since I started to learn JavaScript and HTML as a hobby.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Tetris</b>:<br>
                Try out playing Tetris in various directions (or in random mode, with surprise gameplay direction
                changes).<br>
                Check out the effects after you wipe out several lines at a time or try playing on a grid of a different
                size.<br>
                Not mobile device friendly (Needs a keyboard).<br><br><br>
                <b>Sorta paint</b>:<br>
                A rudimentary program for drawing (it was my test polygon when learning how to manipulate stuff on the
                screen).<br>
                Some parts of the interface might be in Slovenian (no other reason than that is my mother
                language and so far I haven't managed to localize all parts yet)<br><br>
                Why "By guesswork"? Because when working on the programs, the process felt like a mix of
                guesswork, trial and error style, regular course correction and learning as you go. Enjoyed the whole of
                it!
