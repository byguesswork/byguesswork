        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <p>We do not store your data.</p>
        <p>No personal information is collected from the user at any stage of use of the App and none is sent from the
            device and stored outside the device, on which the app is installed, and none is transferred to any third
            party.</p>
        <p>The only data that the App stores on user's device is data needed for the functioning of some of the
            functions that the App offers to the user via the App's user interface (ie. the list of Favorite items
            within the App and the list of recently viewed items within the App itself). The user can choose to delete
            such data from the location where it is stored at any time.</p>
        <p>The only data that might be transfered outside the user's device is data that might be generated and
            subsequently transferred from the device by the Google Play ecosystem, ie. data related to App crash
            reports, errors in App functioning and similar.</p>
        <p>We do not serve ads and we do not use tracking tools, such as Google Analytics. We do not send out emails to
            users.</p>
        <p>The App does not require access to any information from the device such as Location, Contacts List, Camera.
        </p>
