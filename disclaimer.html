            <p>Tetris</p>
            <p>The game keeps a high score list. The highscores are kept in your local browser, not on any server. So
                the
                highscores you see are your own highscores and they do not include any highscores of any other person
                who
                might have visited this site, played a game and reached a high score.
            </p>

            <p>Sorta Paint</p>
            <p>The application offers the possibility to download the doodle you created. The image is downloaded to
                your Downloads folder on your local machine.
