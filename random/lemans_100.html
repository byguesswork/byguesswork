            <!-- <p>Why do we find cars beautiful? (Well, those of us that do.) Why do we seek beauty in cars?
                that would be a long story

            <p>Le Mans 2023, the so-called centenary edition of the 24-hours race (the 91st event, taking place on the
                100th anniversary of the first one). I do not really follow any motor sport, but I was curious to see if
                the <a

                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toyota GR010</a> would make it six victories in a row in
                this endurance race. So I tuned leisurely into the qualifiers … and got hypnotized by the two <a

                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hypercar class cars in red</a>. I am not a Ferrari fanboy
                but, oh, those elegant lines. No wheel arches bulging like mountains in Guilin as on the LMP2 class
                cars, no vertical headlights, and a dome that&apos;s elegant and long. As badass as the 1989 Batmobile,
                meaner than the APC from Aliens, a presence that is sure to have a stay in thoughts of many an
                automotive enthusiast. The fins connecting to the back wing look as if taken straight from a comic book
                - and this is in no way demanded by aerodynamics or rules. The <a
                    href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/2023_6_Hours_of_Spa-Francorchamps_Peugeot_TotalEnergies_Peugeot_9X8_No.94_%28DSC09508%29.jpg/1280px-2023_6_Hours_of_Spa-Francorchamps_Peugeot_TotalEnergies_Peugeot_9X8_No.94_%28DSC09508%29.jpg"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peugeot Hypercars</a> made do completely devoid of a rear
                wing and with an apparently smaller centerline fin but were nonetheless just as effective, with one of
                them running in 1st position several hours into the race. Therefore the spread of options available to
                the designers on how to style the fin and still achieve the wanted result must clearly be ample enough
                and yet the Toyota Hypercar carries a shark fin as level as a ruler, the Porsche car manages some more
                sporty appeal, while the Ferraris opt for the eye catcher option. Why do car designers go to great
                lengths to give their creations allure, elegance, perhaps timelessness? Is beauty a bonus, an additional
                gear?

            <!-- še Wartburg, Polonez -->
            <p>Growing up in a socialist country in the eighties, my taste for cars was modeled by a vehicle landscape
                that reeked of rudimentary, squarish, unassuming. Parking lots were sparsely littered
                predominantly with Yugoslav <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zastava_Skala#/media/File:1970's_Zastava_101.jpg"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zastava</a> cars and a set or Eastern bloc mainstays,
                like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0koda_120" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Skodas</a> from the then Czechoslovakia, Russian <a
                    href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Lada_2107_aka_Lada_Riva_October_1995_1452cc.jpg/1280px-Lada_2107_aka_Lada_Riva_October_1995_1452cc.jpg"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lada</a> and Moskvich cars, Trabant and
                Wartburg from East Germany, Polonez from Poland, some Simcas, Talbots, and a number of models that were
                built in Yugoslavia by license from VW, Renault, Citroen and Fiat. Everything was not gray of course,
                the Skodas tended to be green or yellow or orange, some even had rear spoilers, and there was the
                occasional sporty Fiat X1/9, or the BMW of a guest worker - Gastarbeiters, as they were called - who
                brought the car back home from West Germany, but the everyday reality of the masses was kind of dull and
                not exciting. The early nineties blew this past into history as unflinchingly as a youthful spring
                wind does with the remains of last autumn leaves. In my memory the first import cars that came to be
                adopted en masse were Hondas (mainly civic) and
                Mazdas (mainly 323). I was sort of fresh from getting my driver&apos;s license and took for a ride in my
                Yugo (yes, <a
                    href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/1988_Yugo_GV_in_Blue%2C_front_left.jpg/1280px-1988_Yugo_GV_in_Blue%2C_front_left.jpg"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that Yugo</a>). Before a crossroad, my brain took notice
                of a shiny object passing by in my peripheral vision, a Honda Prelude, 1991 model, the first time I saw
                it outside of an automotive magazine. I remember being struck open-mouthed by that never-ending,
                perfectly curved bonnet, the lights with just the proper proportions and placed in just the manner that
                the total is effortlessly pleasing to the eye -- Whoa! - Screeech - Boom! I hit the back of a car whose
                driver correctly stopped due to traffic conditions. Nothing serious, the front bumper was dented, the
                radiator bent but interestingly enough didn&apos;t leak. Never repaired it, the car served me well for
                the couple-odd years I kept it.
            </p>
            <p>Some twenty-five years later, starting my commute home, tired and half absent after a days work, the
                lookout in my brain again pointed out some object on the port side that must clearly be something that
                screams of attractive. And it was - a Lexus LC coupe. Man, again that never-ending perfectly shaped
                bonnet, the lights that command and guide the gaze - hey, hey! Cool it dude, eyes on the road,
                don&apos;t want to repeat that stupid mishap. Nothing new, men can often be totally simple and cheap -
                some curves (and some beer) and we&apos;re cool.
            </p>
            <p>To any car enthusiast, the sight of a spectacular car, say a Ford GT40, or a memorable one like the
                Magnum P.I.&apos;s Ferrari 308, or a timeless favorite like a Countach or a Charger, brings delight.
                Maybe it&apos;s the stories wound around them, sometimes it is their sheer beauty, sometimes the strong
                aura or maybe the grateful appreciation of the fact that you are witnessing an
                object that required intense levels of mastery and devotion to fathom and bring to life. Totally
                unrelated, except for the otherworldly beauty angle of it, I remember when I saw <a
                    href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/%27Moses%27_by_Michelangelo_JBU210.jpg"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelangelo&apos;s Moses</a> in Rome. So utterly divine
                that reality humbly steps aside and will meet you again outside the basilica where the statue is housed.
                Anyway, once something stunningly beautiful hits the stage, it is easy to root for it. The commentators
                of the Hyperpole were speculating that due to the two Ferrari Hypercar entries taking 1st and 2nd spots
                in qualifications an additional 30k fans would show up on race day. Obviously this not solely due to the
                cars&apos; looks, but to the accumulated heritage of this famed constructor and to the audacity of the
                task they ventured to complete - to win at Le Mans in their first go after 50 years of absence. But it
                was probably Toyota who was under more pressure - they had everything to lose, while Ferrari had
                everything to gain. And they pulled it off with grace, I believe with the invisible aid of fan support
                and enthusiasm spurred by the electrifying beauty of these race cars from la Scuderia Ferrari.
            </p>
            <p>I was rooting for the Japanese team and hoped till the end (or till the brake lockup moment 1h to the
                chequered flag) that the number&nbsp;8 Toyota would manage to turn the situation around, but the
                presence, the magic, the whole package of the 499P cars (what was that electric whizz that could be
                heard only when a Ferrari was decelerating before a corner?) made my heart take side also for these
                race distance-devouring creations in red.
