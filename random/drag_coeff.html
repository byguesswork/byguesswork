            <h1>Effect of drag coefficient on consumption of ICE vehicles</h1>
            <p id="date">September 2025</p>

            <p>This one started as an itch of wanting to get a general idea of the effect drag coefficient has on fuel consumption, more specifically, on fuel consumption of vehicles with an 
                internal combustion engine (ICE). But already after a bit of research a realization surfaced that this would probably turn out into a futile endeavor or at least an activity
                that wouldn't yield any indicative results. As it turns out, the drag coefficient (c<sub>d</sub> or c<sub>x</sub>) does not play such a crucial role when aiming to achieve
                 big improvements of mileage for a vehicle with an ICE (at least compared to EVs) because the efficiency of ICEs is so low that the engine's efficiency gets to be the most 
                 important factor impacting the vehicle's mileage and any other effort has to be satisfied with playing second fiddle here. In an ICE, some 60% of energy stored in the fuel 
                 is wasted in the form of heat and so any gain achieved by an improvement of a vehicle's c<sub>d</sub> (or of any other vector impacting the overall consumption, like rolling
                 resistance of tires) gets to be immediately multiplied by some 0.4 and with that sort of neutralized. EV motors, in comparison, convert stored energy to work with an efficiency 
                 of some 0.9 or 0.95 I think, and so with EVs a much bigger part of improvement of c<sub>d</sub> gets to be translated into a gain in vehicle's fuel efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>But just for the heck of it, a nice candidate to try to quantify the effect of c<sub>d</sub> improvement on consumption of an ICE vehicle is the Volkswagen's Passat,   
                whose 2023 model (available only as station wagon) moves through air quite more stealthily than its predecessor, with a 0.25 number vs the 0.31 of the previous model*. 
                In the early nineties, when the sleek and attractively styled Opel/Vauxhall Calibra hit the lights, I remember the articles rarely forgot to praise its excellent 
                c<sub>d</sub> (my memory serves me the value of 0.31, while internet sources say 0.26 to 0.29, but I guess the internet's right) and what an achievement that was. So
                some 35 years ago it took a coupe's silhouette to dip under 0.3 while today even boxier shapes are able to improve easily on that number, not to mention the relentless 
                onslaught of ever more streamlined EVs in recent years, with Kia's EV4 achieving 0.23, Hyundai's Ioniq 6 boasting 0.21, Tesla S and Mercedes EQE slightly improving even on 
                that and, finally, Lucid company with their Air model dipping below 0.2. Ain't designers and engineers super cool?
            </p>
            <p>So let's crunch some numbers. The VWs, at least in Europe, are (or, due to dieselgate, were) mostly beloved for their diesels. 
                The VW diesel mainstay is the 150 hp engine (both in the 2010-2022 and the 2023+ model) so let's see the numbers for station wagon Passats with that engine
                (data gathered as visitor of a popular mileage tracking site). The 2010 model gets an average of 5.8 l/100km, while the newer one is satisfied 
                with 5.53 liters. A similar improvement of almost 5% is observed also on the vehicles powered by the 150hp gasoline engine, with 6.57l gasoline per 100km needed with the newer model vs 
                6.88 l of the older. But of course, even when this improvement has been noted, nothing is known of the reasons for it and it could just well be that other factors are at play, 
                like drivetrain improvements or anything. Particularly because for the vehicles equipped with a stronger, 190hp diesel engine a 5% INCREASE in consumption can be observed 
                in the numbers. So, it is not sure that the sort of 5% improvement in mileage is solely down to a more streamlined design, but if it were, I guess that would be quite a result. 
            </p>
            <p>But regardless of where improvements came from, cars mileage has improved much in the course of time I happen to be interested in cars. When I was a kid, the Zastava car
                my father and most of our fellow citizens drove (the model 101 with a small Fiat derived 1100 or 1300ccm engine), had a word-of-mouth consumption of 10l/100km. 
                And those cars went nowhere. Achieving 110km/h on the motorway (the 50kms of it we had back then) elicited enthusiasm like launch day on Cape Canaveral.
                Nowadays family cars are much bigger and heavier than then, and with a two- to threefold increase in power make no fuss when pushed past 160km/h while at the same time
                can be satisfied with an overall 6l/100km gasoline on the tankstelle.  
            </p>
            <p>So, I guess I didn't learn much regarding the initial itch, but managed to observe that engineers, designers and all other sorts of petrol heads are the real deal and that their 
                efforts work miracles in progressing us to a more efficient future. I truly love their work, keep it up guys, may results be with you.
            </p>
