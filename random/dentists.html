            <p>One day, from somewhere - the general direction was from space - aliens - what can they be called but
                that - descended to Earth. They didn&apos;t really come in droves, but they came suddenly and
                simultaneously all around the globe. A complete surprise, like the one that was the arrival of Martians
                in The War of the Worlds, and a complete takeover of the whole planet in a matter of hours, at most of
                days in a handful of places that managed somehow to put up a short-lived resistance.
            </p>
            <p>When the giant lens-like objects (much like the common depiction of flying saucers from various sci-fi
                contexts, only without any antennae or other protrusions) started descending in swarms, even though
                humans didn&apos;t know what these were, their first reaction was armed defensive action. But there was
                not much to be done. The alien spaceships had the upper hand throughout, any attempt of attack on them
                was promptly subdued, seemingly without much effort. Fighter jets harassing them, missiles and rockets
                aimed at them were bounced off by an invisible shield, or often simply disappeared as if gone to another
                dimension or pulverized without much trace of remains. The subjugation was inevitable and swift.
            </p>
            <p>What exactly drove them to Earth and what were their intentions was yet unclear, but at least by then we
                will have invented the yellow Babel fish and so language was no obstacle - we understood the Titans and
                they understood us. Titans - with individuals sporting a frame 15 meters in height and weighing 20 tons,
                their name surely was an apt description of their manifestation. Humans could at least find solace in
                the conclusion that our own evolution must have been apparently following a universally ideal path,
                since these Titans that came from a whole another galaxy were oddly similar to us in outward appearance
                (bar the striking difference in size). Two-legged, a muscular body, two upper limbs with five fingers
                each, head sitting on a strong neck and a face with 2 eyes, a Greek nose and a mouth. When regarded from
                the vantage point of a human inhabitant standing at their feet, their body seemed to stretch up forever
                and the head seemed so far away that it was already apparently shrinking towards the top and the angles
                of contours were getting distorted, like the apparent straight-line curving around the horizon.
            </p>
            <p>Other than the takeover, it turned out that the Titans took upon themselves to play a benevolent role on
                this planet, if that can reasonably be said given the circumstances. Their intentions slowly began to
                take shape. Apparently, a big part of their motivation to come to Earth was that they needed workforce
                for some unknown project that demanded hand labor. A large proportion of human individuals older than 18
                were obliged to work in Titan factories that sprung up all around the world, 10 hours per day, 6 days a
                week. Apart from that, everybody was free to pursue a life of their own design (bar plotting an
                insurrection) and the Titans went quite a stretch to make sure humans were fed, healthy and felt
                relatively OK. So that was our new reality, life in a sort of experiment, brought upon us from outside
                and without any real chance to escape from it.
            </p>
            <p>In time it seems the Titans&apos; needs for human labor grew and so they decided to retrain certain human
                occupations to work in their factories. They thought hard and decided that the first to be retrained
                shall be tailors. They saw this this populace as particularly qualified due to its dexterity and they
                reasoned that since the entire human population can easily get dressed even without bespoke tailors,
                there is no need for them to offer their services anymore and that their continuing to do so would
                essentially constitute a waste of workforce. And so overnight all tailors, from the small family shops
                that were serving locals on the busiest streets in low-income countries to haute couture custom tailors
                from the richest of cities were moved to work in factories. The occupation was banned completely and no
                new practitioners were allowed to enter it. No one to take your measurements anymore, no more
                tailor-made suits, no more occasions for gossip and to strengthen social ties. At first it didn&apos;t
                seem like much, but slowly signs of discomfort started to appear. Those that formerly relied on tailors
                slowly became aware of a mood change, a feeling that the totality of life is lacking something: for
                those that attended glamorous parties, the social event just wasn&apos;t the same without the perfect
                attire, while for the rest, the impersonal functional piece of clothing supplied by the Titans just
                wouldn&apos;t cut it compared to the simple dress from the tailor next-door while at the same time a
                connection was missing, one that contributed to the weaving of the strands forming a community. Also,
                the businesses downstream, like the ones selling material to tailors, started to feel the effect.
            </p>
            <p>The next to go were pizza deliveries (yep, autonomous driving still didn&apos;t make it to par…). Again,
                a logical explanation was easily conjured for why they are not needed. Of course, the world didn&apos;t
                stop because they disappeared to go work someplace else, but it changed in ways that were hard to point
                out and to put in words.
            </p>
            <p>These Titans&apos; induced changes were not organic like when the occupation of the lamplighter slowly
                dwindled over time and then vanished completely. Who needs persons to go crawling city pavements at dusk
                to light gas-powered street lamps when cities around the world could nowadays easily serve as runway
                lights to aid spacecrafts in their descent from orbit. In your life you probably know of a Miller (think
                Arthur, Henry or Bode), or a Mueller or a Müller (think German soccer players) and yet perhaps you do
                not know any miller, person with the occupation the Millers, Muellers and Müllers owe their surname to.
                The Smiths of the world are as ubiquitous as can be and yet the village blacksmiths tending to horse
                shoes, fabricating nails and mending axes and cask hoops are today relegated to tourist attractions. If
                we assume that the frequency of an occupational surname in a population is somewhat telling of the share
                of families that were involved with that occupation some centuries ago (like Bakers were bakers, Potters
                were potters, Skinners worked leather), then it follows millers and blacksmiths must have been much more
                common then than today. But the disappearance of such professions was never forceful in any way, it
                happened naturally, in step with the development of the socio-economic reality and the needs stemming
                from there.
            </p>
            <p>The Titans, in their quest to orchestrate life on the planet to suit their needs, got bolder and bolder
                eradicating profession after profession and reskilling their practitioners. The unforeseen and
                unintended consequences started to tear into the social fabric, but the Titans wouldn&apos;t mind.
            </p>
            <p>One day, Titan A went for a jog. It was a funny sight to behold - such a powerful body of more than 15
                meters in height moving along so purposefully. The ground didn&apos;t really shake, when his feet
                touched down, but you could feel a muffled thud, as if the terrain cringed ever so lightly at each
                impact. Then from the side, B joined him, jogging as well.
            </p>

            <p>&quot;You seem to be doing well today, A!&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not looking too bad yourself, B.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Thanks. Lately I have started to take this staying in shape thing a bit more seriously. I&apos;ve
                gotten lazy since we steadied on Earth.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yeah, so far our work here has turned out to be smooth sailing,&quot; replied A.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yup,&quot; agreed B. &quot;Hey, listen, I got this idea... you know, about occupations and the
                wellbeing of human population.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Hmh,&quot; murmured A, all the time intently gazing straight ahead, concentrated on the run.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Dentists. I&apos;ve heard people have to visit them occasionally and it takes them a lot of time
                and money. You know, time wasted.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Hmmh.&quot; A was very serious about his jogging.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And a lot of people seem to be terrified of them, a fear of the pain they might experience during
                the visit.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;They sound like a nasty bunch, these dentists,&quot; added A.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Maybe, but I heard they are very skilled, could come handy in factories.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Currently we are good, no need for additional hands.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Hmm …&quot; B dove into his thoughts. They jogged in silence for a while.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;They eat into resources and scare the rest of the population. Doesn&apos;t sound like too useful to
                me,&quot; finally uttered B.
            </p>
            <p>A looked at him &quot;What do you intend to say?&quot; and then turned to face the course again.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well,&quot; started B, &quot;we have never resorted to elem…&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Are you serious?&quot; A interrupted B and turned to him with a questioning gaze, all the while
                pressing on with the run. &quot;You know the approval of the Council is needed for this.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course I remember. I was just considering the facts and our options.&quot;
            </p>

            <p>Later that day the Titan Council convened and the decision was adopted to go on with the procedure.
            </p>
            <p>And so the next day, upon a mere utterance of a command - or was it perhaps that the trigger was the
                thought passing the synapses of the Titan a moment before elocution - all the dentists were irreversibly
                fated to be gone. With a whoosh, bodies lifted for the sky, dashing through windows or just taking to
                the air from the spot they found themselves in at the moment. Be it they were mothers, fathers, sons,
                sisters or friends, doesn&apos;t matter, none were spared, the caring and competent ones and those that
                their patients regarded as ill-disposed brutes, all went up. Like fireflies all around the world they
                rose to the sky, leaving trails of blue and white smoke behind that rose persistently like pillars
                towards the heavens. And then suddenly all of them, with a puff, no more, elementized (elementize, in
                Titanspeak, to instantaneously disassociate the entire mass of an object into particles of matter in
                their elemental form).
            </p>
            <p>The Titans got their decrease in need for resources and some humans got a short feeling of relief for the
                thought of having to experience pain at the dentist had no substance anymore. But soon severe issues
                started to break out - many people were in terrible pain due to bad oral health, factories started to
                experience outings due to workers not being able to get to work due to acute toothache and rampaging
                oral infections. The human populace started to feel itchy about the Titan overlords and the first cases
                of mutiny in Titan factories happened. Not to mention that all dentist nurses and all services formerly
                supporting dentists were suddenly put out of work permanently, which only added to the general
                discomfort people felt. Many Titan factories were starting to get short on hands. Then the Titans had
                the brilliant idea to re-skill all mechanics …
            </p>
            <p>The moral of the story? Wash your teeth and take care of your oral hygiene, if you are a human. If you
                are a Titan, watch out for unintended and unforeseen consequences of your interventions.
            </p>
            <p>On planet Earth we, the developed consumerist societies, are the Titans. Causing extinction of species,
                driving species out of their ecosystems, introducing species into their non-native ecosystems,
                eradicating entire ecosystems for economic reasons, all done lightly with a flick of a finger to
                egoistically serve our needs. When the change in an ecosystem is gradual, it is not felt and all
                involved parts adapt accordingly. When the changes are abrupt, big and originate outside the system
                (think some asteroid 66 million years ago), the system gets out of whack in unforeseen ways and the
                consequences - as well as their magnitude - are unpredictable. Sure, dry out that marsh, develop the
                wetland, go on with that open-pit mine, cut down all the forests on that continent, but you never know
                what effect one single organism in one of those places has on any other organism and how this effect
                propagates … end eventually gets back to you and whacks you on the head. And there is no one scientific
                way trying to find the lynchpin species to avoid harming - in an ecosystem with 500 species there are
                500 lynchpins. That is what ecosystems are - intricate webs of relationships and for all practical
                purposes the number of causal connections between single species are infinite, and so is the potential
                for consequences in cases of disruptions.
            </p>
            <p>Life on Earth is extremely resilient and will no doubt adapt even to the harshest punishments we Titans
                impose to it. But the process of adaptation to abrupt changes, the search for a new equilibrium point in
                a complex self-adjusting system is, by definition, frantic, violent, and the Titans themselves, being
                part of the ecosystem when living in it, will be on the receiving end in this turbulent, chaotic
                process that is the search. Maybe it is just the news, but it feels to me that Earth is going through a
                humans induced fever.
            </p>
            <p>But in the end, it is not the consequences that we should be considering, watching out for and be
                fearful of (although at this stage it is best not to hide and pretend not to see). It&apos;s the simple
                fact that we are living on a planet that is our home, and a lush and beautiful one to that. Who
                doesn&apos;t love their home, who doesn&apos;t want to look after their own home? It&apos;s high time to
                see our mother home for what it is and start acting lovingly towards it in accordance. Not from fear,
                but for real.
            </p>
