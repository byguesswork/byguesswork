            <p>One day, from somewhere - the general direction was from space - aliens - what can they be called but
                that - descended to Earth. They didn&apos;t really come in droves, but they came suddenly and
                simultaneously all around the globe. A complete surprise, like the one that was the arrival of Martians
                in The War of the Worlds, and a complete takeover of the whole planet in a matter of hours, at most of
                days in a handful of places that managed somehow to put up a short-lived resistance.
            </p>
            <p>When the giant lens-like objects (much like the common depiction of flying saucers from various sci-fi
                contexts, only without any antennae or other protrusions) started descending in swarms, even though
                humans didn&apos;t know what these were, their first reaction was armed defensive action. But there was
                not much to be done. The alien spaceships had the upper hand throughout, any attempt of attack on them
                was promptly subdued, seemingly without much effort. Fighter jets harassing them, missiles and rockets
                aimed at them were bounced off by an invisible shield, or often simply disappeared as if gone to another
                dimension or pulverized without much trace of remains. The subjugation was inevitable and swift.
            </p>
            <p>What exactly drove them to Earth and what were their intentions was yet unclear, but at least by then we
                will have invented the yellow Babel fish and so language was no obstacle - we understood the Titans and
                they understood us. Titans - with individuals sporting a frame 15 meters in height and weighing 20 tons,
                their name surely was an apt description of their manifestation. Humans could at least find solace in
                the conclusion that our own evolution must have been apparently following a universally ideal path,
                since these Titans that came from a whole another galaxy were oddly similar to us in outward appearance
                (bar the striking difference in size). Two-legged, a muscular body, two upper limbs with five fingers
                each, head sitting on a strong neck, and a face with a pair of eyes, a Greek nose, ears and a mouth.
                When regarded from the vantage point of a human inhabitant standing at their feet, their body seemed to
                stretch up forever and the head seemed so far away that it was already apparently shrinking towards the
                top and the angles of contours were getting distorted, like the apparent straight-line curving around
                the horizon.
            </p>
            <p>Other than the takeover, it turned out that the Titans took upon themselves to play a benevolent role on
                this planet, if that can reasonably be said given the circumstances. Their intentions slowly began to
                take shape. Apparently, a big part of their motivation to come to Earth was that they needed workforce
                for some project that demanded hand labor. A large proportion of human individuals older than 18
                were obliged to work in Titan factories that sprung up all around the world, 10 hours per day, 6 days a
                week. Apart from that, everybody was free to pursue a life of their own design (bar plotting an
                insurrection) and the Titans went quite a stretch to make sure humans were fed, healthy and felt
                relatively OK. So that was our new reality, life in a sort of experiment, brought upon us from outside
                and without any real chance to escape from it.
            </p>
            <p>In time it seems the Titans&apos; needs for human labor grew and so they decided to retrain certain human
                occupations to work in their factories. They thought hard and decided that the first to be retrained
                shall be tailors. They saw this populace as particularly qualified due to its dexterity and they
                reasoned that since the entire human population can easily get dressed even without bespoke tailors,
                there is no need for them to offer their services anymore and that their continuing to do so would
                essentially constitute a waste of workforce. And so overnight all tailors, those running small family
                shops on busy streets in low-income countries to haute couture custom tailors from the richest of
                cities, were moved to work in factories. The occupation was banned completely and no new practitioners
                were allowed to enter it. No one to take your measurements anymore, no more tailor-made suits, no more
                occasions for gossip, for nurturing of social ties. At first it didn&apos;t seem like much, but slowly
                signs of discomfort started to appear. Those that formerly relied on tailors slowly became aware of a
                mood change, a feeling that the totality of life is lacking something: for those that attended glamorous
                social events, the experience just couldn&apos;t be the same without the perfect attire, and for the
                other group, the impersonal functional piece of clothing supplied by the Titans just wouldn&apos;t cut
                it compared to the simple dress from the tailor next-door and at the same time they felt that a
                connection was missing, a meaningful strand in the fabric of community. Besides that, some of the
                businesses downstream, those that were previously selling material to tailors, were hit hard from the
                fallout of revenue.
            </p>
            <p>The next to go were pizza deliveries (yep, autonomous driving still didn&apos;t make it to par…). Again,
                a logical explanation was easily conjured for as to why they are not needed. Of course, the world
                didn&apos;t stop because they disappeared to go work someplace else, but it changed in ways that were
                hard to point out and to put in words. Many similar prohibitions to practice certain professions
                followed.
            </p>
            <p>The changes enforced by the Titans were not organic, such as was the gradual dwindling of the profession
                of lamplighter and then finally its disappearance. Nowadays there is no use in having persons crawl
                city pavements at dusk to light gas-powered street lamps when cities around the world could easily serve
                as runway lights for spacecrafts descending from orbit. Let&apos;s consider some more examples of
                changes in prevalence of occupations. Everybody probably knows a person with the surname Miller (think
                Arthur, Henry or Bode), or a Mueller or a Müller (think German soccer players) and yet perhaps you do
                not know any miller, person with the occupation the Millers, Muellers and Müllers (and Meuniers,
                Molinaris, Mlinars...) owe their surname to. The Smiths of the world are as ubiquitous as can be
                (Ferreira, Kovalenko, Kovacs, Kovačević...) and yet nowadays the village blacksmiths tending to horse
                shoes, fabricating nails and mending axes and cask hoops are relegated to tourist attractions. If we
                assume that the frequency of an occupational surname in a population is somewhat telling of the
                recurrence of persons practicing the profession at the origin of such surname some centuries ago (like
                Bakers were bakers, Potters were potters, Skinners worked leather), then it follows that millers and
                blacksmiths must have been much more common in the past than today. But the relative decline of such
                professions with time was never forceful in any way, it happened naturally, in step with the development
                of the socio-economic environment and the needs stemming therefrom. Well, Titans&apos; changes
                wouldn&apos;t allow for gradual adaptation, they were shocks that rocked the system.
            </p>
            <p>The Titans, in their quest to orchestrate life on the planet to suit their needs, got bolder and bolder
                eradicating profession after profession and reskilling their practitioners. The unforeseen and
                unintended consequences started to tear into the social fabric, but the Titans wouldn&apos;t mind.
            </p>
            <p>One day, Titan A went for a jog. It was a funny sight to behold - such a powerful body of more than 15
                meters in height moving along so purposefully. The ground didn&apos;t really shake, when his feet
                touched down, but you could feel a muffled thud, as if the terrain cringed lightly at each
                impact. Then from the side, B joined him, jogging as well.
            </p>

            <p>&quot;You seem to be doing well today, A!&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Not looking too bad yourself, B.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Thanks. Lately I have started to take this staying in shape thing a bit more seriously. I&apos;ve
                gotten lazy since we steadied on Earth.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yeah, so far our work here has turned out to be smooth sailing,&quot; replied A.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Yup,&quot; agreed B. &quot;Hey, listen, I got this idea... you know, about occupations and the
                wellbeing of human population.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Hmh,&quot; murmured A, all the time intently gazing straight ahead, concentrated on the run.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Dentists. I&apos;ve heard people have to visit them occasionally and it takes them a lot of time
                and money. You know, time wasted.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Hmmh.&quot; A was very serious about his jogging.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;And a lot of people seem to be terrified of them, a fear of the pain they might experience during
                their visit at the dentist&apos;s.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;They sound like a nasty bunch, these dentists,&quot; commented A.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Maybe, but I heard they are very skilled, could come handy in factories.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Currently we are good, no need for additional hands.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Hmm …&quot; B dove into his thoughts. They jogged in silence for a while.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;They eat into resources and are a scare for the rest of the population. Doesn&apos;t sound like too
                useful to me,&quot; finally uttered B.
            </p>
            <p>A looked at him &quot;What do you intend to say?&quot; and then turned to face the course again.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Well,&quot; started B, &quot;we have never resorted to elem…&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Are you serious?&quot; A interrupted B and turned to him with a questioning gaze, all the while
                pressing on with the run. &quot;You know the approval of the Council is needed for this.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Of course I remember. I was just considering the facts and our options.&quot;
            </p>

            <p>Later that day the Titan Council convened and the decision was adopted to go on with the procedure.
            </p>
            <p>And so the next day, upon a mere utterance of a command - or was it perhaps that the trigger was the
                thought passing the synapses of the Titan a moment before elocution - all the dentists of the world were
                irreversibly fated to be gone. With a whoosh, bodies lifted for the sky, dashing through windows or just
                taking to the air from the spot they found themselves in at the moment. Be it they were mothers,
                fathers, sons, sisters or friends, doesn&apos;t matter, none were spared, the caring and competent ones
                and those that their patients regarded as ill-disposed brutes, all went up. Like fireflies all around
                the world they rose to the sky, leaving trails of blue and white smoke behind that rose persistently
                like pillars towards the heavens. And then suddenly all of them, with a puff, no more, elementized
                (elementize, in Titanspeak, to instantaneously disassociate the entire mass of a body into particles of
                matter in their elemental form).
            </p>
            <p>The Titans got their decrease in need for resources and some humans got a short feeling of relief for the
                thought of having to experience pain at the dentist&apos;s had no substance anymore. But soon severe
                issues started to break out - many people were in terrible pain due to bad oral health, factories
                started to experience outings due to workers not being able to get to work from acute toothache and
                rampaging oral infections. The human populace started to feel itchy about the Titan overlords and the
                first cases of mutiny in Titan factories happened. Not to mention that all dentist nurses and all
                services formerly supporting dentists were suddenly put out of work permanently, which only fueled the
                general dissatisfaction brewing within the human population. Many factories were starting to get short
                on hands. Then the Titans had the brilliant idea to re-skill all mechanics…
            </p>
            <p>The moral of the story? Wash your teeth and take care of your oral hygiene, if you are a human. If you
                are a Titan, watch out for unintended and unforeseen consequences of your interventions.
            </p>
            <p>On planet Earth we, the developed consumerist societies, are the Titans - causing extinction of species,
                driving species out of their ecosystem, introducing others into non-native ecosystems, terraforming
                whole landscapes, destroying ecosystems, all performed lightly to egoistically serve our needs. Sure,
                dry out that marsh, develop the wetland, go on with that open-pit mine, cut down all the forests on that
                continent, but you never know what effect one single organism or physical factor in one of those places
                has on any other and how this effect propagates … and eventually gets back to you and whacks you on the
                head. Even if we limit our reasoning only to living organisms within one single ecosystem (and disregard
                its physical environment component and all other ecosystems on the planet and the gazillion of ways the
                parts of the lot influence each other), there is no scientific way with which to single out one lynchpin
                species, a such one that by taking care to preserve its presence in the ecosystem intact - despite
                otherwise an abusive encroachment into its living environment - you would succeed in avoiding a major
                deterioration or collapse of the ecosystem itself. No use - in an ecosystem of 500 species there are 500
                lynchpins. That is what ecosystems are - intricate webs of relationships and for all practical purposes
                the number of causal connections between single species is infinite, and so is the potential for
                consequences in cases of disruptions. Now zoom out to consider the whole Earth, which is a system of
                systems, in the same way and it becomes obvious that the potential for the whole to get out of whack -
                due to our interventions - in unforeseen ways is considerable.
            </p>
            <p>Life on Earth is practically infinitely resilient and won&apos;t care to bitch and complain while busy
                adapting to the harshest of punishments we Titans decide to impose on it. But the adaptation of an
                insolubly complex closed system replete with feedback loops (which is the totality of the Earth system
                with its components of bio-, hydro-, geo- and atmosphere) to disrupting changes takes the form of a
                search for a new equilibrium point and such a process is frantic, unpredictable and can be violent. And
                so the Titans, since they are not separate from the totality of the system, will be on the receiving end
                in this turbulent, chaotic process that is the search. Maybe it is just the news, but it feels to me
                that Earth is already going through a fever caused by the Titans, ehm, humans.
            </p>
            <p>But in the end, it is not the consequences that we should be considering, watching out for and be
                fearful of (although at this stage it is best not to hide and pretend not to see). It&apos;s the simple
                fact that we are living on a planet that is our home, and a lush and beautiful one to that. Who
                doesn&apos;t love their home, who doesn&apos;t want to look after their own home? It&apos;s high time to
                see our mother home for what it is and start acting lovingly towards it in accordance. Not from fear,
                but for real.
            </p>
