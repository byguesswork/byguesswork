            <h1>A Hobbyist's Take at How Sensible are EVs, CO2-wise</h1>
            <p id="date">June 2023</p>
            <p>Previously I was wondering just how sensible are plug-ins in terms of lowering CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
                (you can <a href="plug-in.html">read about that here</a>). The next logical step after that would have
                been to check the same for EVs. Except that I didn't. Well, I once ran a half-marathon and then
                everybody was saying &quot;Now you should go for a marathon next year&quot; and I was reasoning like
                &quot;Hell no, just because it seems the most logical next thing or everybody says so, I am not gonna do
                it.&quot; And so I wasn't. Like seriously. Until one day, when flipping through a magazine while in some
                checkout line, I read that Jack Gylenhall was running like almost a half-marathon distance every day in
                preparation for a movie (or sth like that) and I said to myself that if that skinny Brokeback cowboy can
                do a half marathon day after day, well heck, then I should surely be able to survive one marathon. And
                so I did. Plenty of 60- or 70-somethings crossed the finish line before me, but I wasn't going to
                complain about it. (I was in my late thirties then but was never a runner, on both occasions I trained
                for a couple of months prior to the event and then stashed the sneakers away.)
            </p>
            <p class="no-para">
                So, how about EVs? Just because EVs don&apos;t have a tailpipe, it doesn&apos;t follow that driving them
                doesn&apos;t cause CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It does, it is just that they occur someplace else and at a
                different time, ie. they are not being generated in the moment the EV is spinning its wheels and in the
                hardware where its driver is seated as is the case with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE).
            </p>
            <p class="no-para">
                CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from electric vehicles come from 3 directions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>from CO<sub>2</sub> footprint of electricity generation (characteristic of the power network into
                    which an EV is plugged-in to charge its traction battery), </li>
                <li>the emissions created during the production of the EV&apos;s traction battery (most often than not a
                    lithium ion battery), amortized during the battery&apos;s lifetime (for the purpose of this text,
                    250,000 km driven by the vehicle). </li>
                <li>the energy losses during charging, estimated to 15% (it seems that most sources put it between 10
                    and 25%)
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Let's calculate these components.</p>
            <h2>Calculations - theory</h2>
            <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are expressed in g CO<sub>2</sub> per km driven. Here's how to calculate them
                for EVs:</p>
            <p>(1) <u>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from electricity consumption</u><br>
            <p class="no-para indent"> Average electricity consumption of the vehicle (in kWh/100 km); </p>
            <p class="no-para indent_more viva_italia"> TIMES </p>
            <p class="no-para indent"> CO<sub>2</sub> emission from electricity generation, characteristic for the
                network from which the EV gets its glow juice from (in g CO<sub>2</sub> /kWh of electricity produced);

            <p class="no-para indent_more viva_italia">

            </p>
            <p class="no-para indent">
                1,15 to account for the 15% losses at charging point (from point 3 above);
            </p>
            <p class="no-para indent_more  viva_italia">
                DIVIDED BY
            </p>
            <p class="no-para indent">
                100 to express the value per km instead of per 100 kms.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>(2) <u>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions related to lithium battery</u>
            </p>
            <p class="no-para indent">
                Vehicle&apos;s battery size (in kWh);
            </p>
            <p class="no-para indent_more  viva_italia">
                TIMES
            </p>
            <p class="no-para indent">

            <p class="no-para indent_more viva_italia">
                DIVIDED BY
            </p>
            <p class="no-para indent">
                250.000 (to get a value of g CO<sub>2</sub> due to battery production per each km driven by the vehicle
                during its lifetime, which in this text is, rather arbitrarily, set to a generous 250k km).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Wait, why have add losses here to the calculation at point 1 when noone talks about losses when
                calculating consumption for gas guzzlers? Don't the trucks that haul petrol across the country to get it
                to gas stations add up to losses then too? Well that would rather be similar in content (and probably in
                size too) to losses in electricity transmission over long distances. But in addition to that, charging
                EVs also incurs losses right at the charging point (the 15% added in the calculation) while usually all
                the petrol that passes through the hose at the petrol station also makes it into my car, I don't tend to
                sprinkle it around water gun style. (There are some losses in the form of vapours when filling up cars
                that run on dinosaurs and ferns, but those don&apos;t affect consumption calculations.)
            </p>
            <p>Re: one other factor at calculation 1, the values for emissions from electricity generation vary a lot,
                for the purpose of this text the following reference values will be used:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World average: 440 g CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh of electricity produced<sup>2</sup></li>
                <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France: 79 g CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh<sup>3</sup>></li>
                <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photovoltaics (PV) on roof: 40 g CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh<sup>4</sup>></li>
                <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as not to make EVs look bad, the emisions values for electricity generation
                    that relies on coal won&apos;t be presented in the table, but that value is 900 g
                    CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh and from there on you can make the calculation yourself</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To get the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the vehicle, the 2 components from the 2 calculations above have
                to
                be summed!
            </p>
            <h2>Selection of cars</h2>
            <p>One small (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Up#E-up">VW e-up</a>, 32 kWh battery), one
                bigger (Tesla 3 Long Range, 75 kWh battery)</p>
            <h2>Data rules</h2>
            <p>The 2 pieces of data about vehicle consumption mentioned below (can that be called a sample?) are
                real-world consumption data logged by users from a popular site for logging fuel consumption.
                Requirements: cars year of make 2018 or newer; data from at least 100 users; for the average
                consumptions below I took the mean value between the average consumption of all cars and the consumption
                of the median car, just in case the average is perhaps distorted due to any extreme value on any of the
                extremes.

            <h2>Sorta analysis</h2>
            <p class="half-para">Charging the Tesla 3 in an average corner of the world (where during production of 1
                kWh of electricity 440 g CO<sub>2</sub> are emitted) gives already a good result, but still one that is
                nowhere spectacular. Modern medium sized diesel cars are easily satisfied with less than 5.0 l fuel per
                100 km (which would give the same CO<sub>2</sub> emissions figures as from a Tesla 3 in an average
                region as regards electricity production) and 5,8 l gasoline per 100 km offers no challenge for modern
                gasoline self-charging hybrids. (I drive an older spec self-charging hybrid, ie. a hybrid that is not a
                plug-in hybrid, I am definitely not able to hypermile it but my average consumption, calculated at the
                gas station from fuel-ups over the last 4 years, is 5.1&nbsp;l/100 km or 46 US mpg.)
            </p>
            <p class="half-para">But still, that is comparing the consumption of the average Tesla 3 with the
                consumption of a car from the lower part of the distribution of data about consumption of ICEs. I would
                estimate the average real-world consumption figures of ICE cars, at least in Europe, to be 7-8 l/100 km
                for gasoline and 6-7 l/100 km for diesel cars, so at least some 20% worse than an average Tesla 3. If
                the same Tesla is driven in France or Norway, where the CO<sub>2</sub> footprint of electricity
                production is low, then no fossil fuel car can realistically have emissions so low (2-2.5&nbsp;l fuel
                per 100 km driven).
            </p>
            <p>Conversely, if you charge your Tesla 3 in a corner of the world where CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from
                electricity generation are high, as in where sourced mainly from coal, when the figure for
                CO<sub>2</sub> emissions climbs over 900g/kWh generated, then driving your EV doesn&apos;t make much
                sense. (Yes, electric cars are fun, yes, Teslas are cool, yes, EVs can be way cheaper to run than ICEs
                and all that, but here the angle on things is exclusively from the perspective of CO<sub>2</sub>, so
                that&apos;s where the absence of sense comes from.) Namely, in this case you would realistically be
                nearing a drive where 200 g of CO<sub>2</sub> are emitted per each km driven, a lousy result.
            </p>
            <p>In this sense I find it pretty stupid, or better deceptive and offensive, when car producers for their
                EVs proudly wave the banner of &quot;CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: 0 g&quot; in every ad or catalogue. Well,
                sorry, that&apos;s crap. There should be two numbers there, one for on the spot emissions (which are
                nil) and one for the driving imputed emissions which would take into account some average numbers for
                battery production pertaining to that car and a range for electricity generation numbers pertaining to
                the country where this ad is being shown or this vehicle is being sold.
            </p>
            <p class="half-para">As regards batteries, it seems that with current battery production technology the size
                of the lithium ion battery can have quite an impact on the overall emissions of an electric car - see
                the 39 g of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per kilometer driven for the Tesla 3 vs the 17 for the Volkswagen
                minicar. The small VW e-up (which is, I think, discontinued as of 2023 but there are plenty of other
                electric cars with smallish batteries available), when driven in a part of the world with average carbon
                intensity of electricity production, offers CO<sub>2</sub> emissions figures that can be reached only by
                serious hypermilers, while when driven in low carbon intensity countries (Vive la France) is completely
                out of reach of the most extreme of the sparsamest of drivers. And conversely, big electric cars with
                batteries over 90 kWh (a Mercedes-Benz EQS packs a 110 kWh Li-ion battery) and then also probably higher
                average consumption (say 25 kWh/100 km) would come out at 180 g CO<sub>2</sub>/km (same as 8 l gasoline
                or 6.7 l diesel/100km) and so offer no benefit whatsoever in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
                reductions. Note that for each kilometer that a car with 100 kWh of batteries covers on the road, it
                emits - from an accounting perspective that is, for the CO<sub>2</sub> has already been emitted during
                production of its batteries - an amount of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent to what comes out of the tailpipe
                of a gasoline car that consumes 2 l/100 km, solely for the fact that it sports a battery of 100 kWh.
            </p>
            <p>But we humans are where we came to be - or basically we are what we are - because we excel at one thing:
                standing on the shoulders of giants (or actually anyone) that came before us. And so there is no
                question that all of the constituents of the equation - battery, drivetrain and electricity production
                technology - will eventually be improved to the point where every and any electric car will be a
                no-brainer in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions plausibility.
