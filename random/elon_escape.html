            <p>Why? I have no clue and, frankly, have no interest to know. But his peculiar intent verges on another
                question. Why do we humans go such distance to separate ourselves from nature? Why do we want to
                escape from it? Why does it seem that, as regards our relationship to nature, our actions tend to be
                such that we want to have complete control over it? My hunch is fear.
            </p>
            <p>Vegetables that never set their roots in soil. Cultured meat. Robo-waiters, robo-chefs, robo-pets.
                What&apos;s next? Will we be placing orders for genetically engineered kids? (Looks like Ken. Check. IQ
                above Einstein&apos;s. Check. Flies like Superman. Check.) Will we learn how to move gestation out
                of the womb into some hydroponics-like gizmo? Do we want each of us to end up in some Odyssey 2001-esque
                pod in space, self-sufficient in a sterile clean environment, completely alone? I am not against
                progress - heat pumps keep beer cold and houses warm, computers can do a whole lot of useful and fun
                stuff and I would never trade the safety of a modern car for something barely half a century old, which
                would wrap around you like a can of sardines in the event of an accident.
            </p>
            <p>But regardless of the fact that as a collective we are able to spit out a shit ton of glitzy and
                extremely powerful stuff per nanosecond, we are not above nature. We are well part of it. If you break
                a leg, hospital staff tends to the wound, sets the bone straight and puts a cast on your leg, but it is
                ultimately the body that does the healing of the soft tissue and the regeneration of bone structure. No
                technology can do that for you. And why would we even seek to achieve to be able to do so? The ability
                is already there, the result of gazillions of generations of life forms endlessly permutating in the
                need to find yet another successful new trick to add to their survival toolkit. Mind you, the ability is
                embedded, free and available to everyone, at any time.
            </p>
            <p>Control it, if you can&apos;t love or you fear it.
            </p>
            <p>Nature is endlessly complex. In the few billion years things have been happening by guesswork on this
                planet (ie. evolution has had time to shape life here), innumerable idiosyncratic connections, reactions
                and causal relationships have sprung up that ultimately produced an immensely complex system. We humans
                can&apos;t even predict weather properly (despite the enormous computing and brain power) so how can we
                even begin to hope to understand all implications stemming from all connections in the natural world.
                And so our brain - out from the same survival mechanism that we share with all life on the planet - in
                its effort to protect its two legged carrier from the dangers it perceives in all directions, starts to
                exert
                control on the outside world. After that it&apos;s only a short way to hunting large predators to
                extinction, stone fortifications, management of river beds, agriculture based on pesticides, laws to
                protect the haves from the havenots … while some wish to altogether leave the planet for an artificial
                world. Because something sterile, built by humans from the ground up, is understandable, controllable
                and predictable at all times. Less threat for the nervous monkey inside the skull.

            <p>I have no memory for poetry verses whatsoever but there is one poem that found a steady place in my mind,
                Dog, by Charles Bukowski:
            </p>
            <p>a single dog<br>
                walking alone on a hot sidewalk of<br>
                summer<br>
                appears to have the power<br>
                of ten thousand gods.<br>
                why is this?
            </p>
            <p> Similar to the jist of this poem, to me, is the sense of these words from the Bible: &quot;Consider the
                lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not...&quot; But unlike the dog and the lilies, we seem to
                have lost the grace and the pride that come from being rooted in nature, being continuously connected
                <!-- come from being strongly connected with nature and its endless -->
                with its endless flow of plenty. We worry, we fret and strive, we cannot relax or stand still.
            </p>
            <p>I like the vibe of the commotion on the deck of Star Trek&apos;s Enterprise. I very much enjoy the
                atmosphere and the ecosystems of gadgetry in Star Wars, Galactica, Captain Harlock, Galaxy Express,
                Cowboy Bebop, Robotech (or Macross, if you will) … hell, I&apos;ve probably let my mind float in one too
                many fantastical worlds as a kid (wonderful moments!), but I&apos;ll tell you, when I step into a
                forest, my face settles into a smile and, once engulfed by the thick shade of the calm tree
                trunks... a sigh of relief. Home.
