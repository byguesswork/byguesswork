            <h1>A granter pattern for reducing the size of private instance methods in JavaScript</h1>
            <p id="date">December 2025</p>

            <p>
                I am not a programmer and my theoretical background is that of an amateur hobbyist (in my case quite lacking) and so I might be getting things 
                completely wrong here, but the way I understand it is that when using classes in JavaScript, private instance methods take up more memory than 
                public methods because the first are stored in each instance of the class (as a separate copy of that method that is accessible to that particular
                instance only), while the latter are only stored once in the prototype of the class and from there are available to each instance of the class and
                so do not add any extra weight to an instance.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was working on this little thing the other day and for no real reason set out to make some method private but - again for no other reason than
                pure curiosity - was also considering the potential memory impact this would have in case many instances of its class would be created. So I was dabbling around 
                on how to prevent an unnecessary increase of memory usage and I had this idea to minimize the size of the private method by having it only serve as a gateway 
                that enables the execution of a code heavy public method, say of an event handler that should ideally be accessible only from within the class. Like so:
            </p>
<br>
                class SomeClass {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#passGranted; // hash symbol denotes private elements (fields, methods)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constructor() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.#passGranted = false;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// some code, including a callback named #granter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// that is a proxy/gateway for some code heavy event handler;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// ...addEventListener(someEvent, this.#granter.bind(this));<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#granter() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.#passGranted = true;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.someCodeHeavyEventHandler();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;someCodeHeavyEventHandler() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(this.#passGranted) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.#passGranted = false;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// considerable amount of code<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}<br><br>
<p>
    So someCodeHeavyEventHandler() is public and therefore optimized in the sense of memory management, but its execution is as if it were not public,
    i.e. it is not possible to run it at will from outside of the class as the pass to run it is granted in the private method that is called only as an event handler.
    Sort of the best of both worlds (if I understand correctly). 
    Nothing big really, and nothing new, but within the arc of my journey with learning to program, this was a discovery I came up with by myself and have not
    learned about elsewhere. In my hobbyist work such moments of eureka are really like the best thing there is. When you set out to solve a conundrum
    and succeed in coming up with an effective and efficient solution it feels like a small victory and the feeling this brings is really like the best thing there is.
</p>
<p>
    It&apos;s also quite interesting how our brains work. When still trying to solve this thing, I remember at a certain point I recalled the singleton pattern from Java,
    which is sort of a similar concept (lots of beating around the bush to get to a thing, but in this way making sure to keep it secure),
    and started thinking about it and some minutes later this solution came to my mind. It is as if while you are mulling about something
    the brain combines 1 + 1 in the background and then floats a solution to your consciousness. Quite a beautiful and interesting experience.
