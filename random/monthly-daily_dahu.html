            <p>By storm, that is how things take you. Sometimes. Unsuspecting, unprepared. ... Working behind the desk I was. Still working, yes, but now headphones 
                refused to be kept to the background, they slithered into conscience. What is this melody, so harmonious, inviting, conscience asked itself enchanted,
                each time 
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv4KlY6A7tU&list=RDBv4KlY6A7tU&t=260s">this song</a>
                made it into the algorithm some way or another.

                (Link leads to some midpoint of song. Song starts at 0:00 of course, just pasted the &mdash;for the attention lacking peoples that we are of late&mdash; 
                link to the second, concluding part of the song. If you think that it is not becoming to skip parts on the way to the climax,

                Better so. When I was a teenager, we listened to whole albums. From start to finish, no skipping, despite CDs and all. Sometimes I might even have 
                put on Use your illusion I and II one after the other, full albums. Or maybe not, that would have perhaps been a stretch. I don't remember now. Anyway. 
                But to digress a bit more, funny how we managed to endure listening through the songs we didn't particularly like on an album then, even though we 
                needn't have. I don't think this is possible today.)

                So the band is Black Sea Dahu (from Switzerland of all places) and this tune unfailingly stopped me dead in the tracks each time it got between my ears. 
                First is like waves calmly sloshing onto the shore and then it proceeds to 
                build this soothing atmosphere, such that as if echoes the hum of nature's vibrations background. Or I don't know how to describe the feeling
                this song gives (to me at least), but anyway something very harmonious, calming, calling, something that sings to the soul effortlessly. 
                And the delivery is marvelous &ndash; unpretentious, merely doing the song that wants to be done, no drama, nothing showy. The soundscape is simple, 
                not much going on there, but it manages to create a presence that makes itself felt. What a blabber, I guess I would just like to say I find the 
                tune very beautiful and pleasant. Other tunes from this band give off the same magic as well.

                I also find of interest the fact that some of the band members are siblings. Of course, not unheard of in music, but not very 
                common either. Bee Gees, The Beach Boys,
                <a target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48pFXE28y8Y&list=RD48pFXE28y8Y&start_radio=1">Cowboy Junkies</a> and
                <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/h5PiROGaPXg?list=RDh5PiROGaPXg&t=26">Greta Van Fleet</a>
                come to mind (I think in each of these bands, 3 band members are siblings). I wonder in what ways does this affect the dynamic within the band.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, always a nice surprise to stumble upon beautiful music that is so refreshingly and assuredly something of its own.
