            <h1>To plug-in, or not to plug-in? (emissions-wise)</h1>
            <p id="date">Feb 2023</p>
            <p>Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (or PHEVs, or simply plug-ins) are a proposition for how a vehicle owner
                can cut back on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from their driving. But just how good are they at this task? If
                used correctly, they sure (or probably) can bring savings in terms of money spent for fuel for their
                owners, but even though this aspect is very important, I view the mission to cut back emissions as the
                primary angle from which they should be looked at. After all, isn&apos;t electrification of road traffic
                and promotion of electric vehicles (of which PHEVs are a subgroup) mainly aimed at reducing
                CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from road transport, as part of wider climate-related actions?</p>
            <p>Out of curiosity and just for the heck of it I set out to make an analysis of sorts to see how they
                compare, purely in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (skipping the considerations about fuel cost
                savings altogether).</p>
            <p class="no-para">CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from plug-ins come from 3 directions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>from fossil fuel burned in the combustion engine component of the plug-in drive system,</li>
                <li>from CO<sub>2</sub> footprint of electricity generation (characteristic of the power network into
                    which a plug-in is, well, plugged-in to charge the battery for the electric motor component of its
                    drive system), </li>
                <li>the emissions created during the production of the plug-in&apos;s traction battery (most often than
                    not a lithium ion battery), amortized during the battery&apos;s lifetime (for the purpose of this
                    text, 250,000 km driven by the vehicle).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Let's calculate these components.</p>
            <h2>Calculations</h2>
            <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are expressed in g CO<sub>2</sub> per km driven. Here's how to calculate them:
            </p>
            <p>(1) CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuel burned:<br> Average fossil fuel consumption of the vehicle
                (in l/100 km) * 2300 (gasoline engines produce 2300 g of CO<sub>2</sub> per litre of gasoline consumed;
                for diesel fuel, use 2680 instead of 2300 here) / 100 (to express the value per km instead of per 100
                kms)</p>
            <p>(2) CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from electricity consumption<br> Average electricity consumption of the
                vehicle (in kWh/100 km) * CO<sub>2</sub> emission from electricity generation, characteristic for the
                network from which the plug-in gets its glow juice from (in g CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh of electricity
                produced) / 100 to express the value per km instead of per 100 kms)<br> The values for emissions from
                electricity generation vary a lot, for the purpose of this text the following reference values will be
                used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World average: 440 g CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh of electricity produced<sup>2</sup></li>
                <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France: 79 g CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh<sup>3</sup>></li>
                <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photovoltaics (PV) on roof: 40 g CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh<sup>4</sup>></li>
            </ul>
            <p>(3) CO<sub>2</sub> emissions related to lithium battery<br>
                Vehicle&apos;s battery size (in kWh) * g CO<sub>2</sub> emitted to produce 1 kWh of lithium
                battery<sup>1</sup> / 250.000 (to get a value of g CO<sub>2</sub> due to battery production per each km
                driven by the vehicle during its lifetime, which in this text is, rather arbitrarily, set to 250k km)
            </p>
            <p>To get the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the vehicle, the 3 components have to be summed!</p>
            <p>In order to see how fit are plug-ins for their task, I will compare the performance of a plug-in
                (emissions-wise, that is) to the relevant values of its sibling that comes equipped with an internal
                combustion engine (ICE) only.</p>
            <h2>Data rules</h2>
            <p>All data about vehicle consumption mentioned below are averages of data from a popular site where users
                log their real-world consumption data. Requirements: cars year of make 2018 or newer; at least 10,000 km
                of logged data; ideally the same amount of kms logged for gasoline and for electricity consumption and
                ideally at least one full year of data. After sorting, the top and bottom 5% of sorted vehicles scrapped
                to avoid extreme values. For the average consumptions for diesel and gasoline-only cars I took the mean
                value between the average consumprion of all cars and the consumption of the median car, just in case
                the average is perhaps distorted due to any extreme value on any of the extremes. I am not a data
                scientist in any way so this list of requirements might not be ideal/necessary/logical, but it is the
                one I used.</p>
            <h2>Carz analysis</h2>
            <h3>Volkswagen passat</h3>
            <p>A VW passat is very handy for this comparison, as you can get it in diesel, gasoline engine only and
                plug-in versions and they put a similar number of hp on the road.</p>
            <p class="no-para"><em>Plug-in (VW passat GTE)</em></p>
            <ul class="no-para">
                <li>Average gasoline consumption: 4.0 l/100 km (which per calculation (1) translates to: 4 * 2300 / 100
                    = 92.0 g CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per each km driven)</li>
                <li>Average electricity consumption: 11.5 kWh/100 km (depending on electricity source, translates to 4.6
                    to 50.6 g CO<sub>2</sub>/km)</li>
                <li>Battery capacity: 13 kWh (as per calculation (3) translates to: 13 * 130,000 / 250,000 = 6.8 g
                    CO<sub>2</sub>/km)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Add the 3 together and the plug-in passat comes in at <strong>103 to 149 g CO<sub>2</sub>/km</strong>.

            <ul>
                <li>Average gasoline consumption: 7,1 l/100 km (as per calculation (1) translates to: 7.1 * 2300 / 100 =
                    <strong> 163.3 g CO<sub>2</sub>/km</strong>)
                </li>

            </ul>
            <p>So, if you charge a passat GTE PHEV in an average corner of the world (in the sense of carbon intensity
                of electricity generation) and then you go around driving it rather averagely, your car's CO<sub>2</sub>
                emissions would be very much in line with a diesel passat (149 vs 155 g CO<sub>2</sub>) and less than
                10% below the value for a gasoline powered, ICE-only passat (163 g CO<sub>2</sub>).<br> If you would
                drive the same plug-in across India, South Africa, Indonesia or Poland, where the carbon intensity of
                electricity generation is above world's average<sup>2</sup>, then your emissions would come out at at
                least 170 g CO<sub>2</sub>/km, so above the average value for any version of the same car that comes
                equipped solely with an ICE. In such places, at least from the perspective of curbing CO<sub>2</sub>
                emissions, driving a plug-in to achieve that mission brings to mind a line from a David Bowie song:
                &quot;And I&apos;ve been putting out fire / With gasoline.&quot;<br> If you happen to live in a part of
                the world where carbon intensity of electricity generation is low though, like France, Norway, New
                Zealand, Uruguay<sup>2</sup>, or you mainly fill your car from a PV installation, then the
                CO<sub>2</sub> emissions savings you get (compared to same car that is powered solely by an ICE) can be
                around 33%, provided, of course, you regularely fill your car with electricity.

            <h3>Toyota RAV4</h3>
            <p>Toyota RAV4 comes as a plug-in, a regular hybrid or a normal ICE (gasoline). I will compare the plug-in
                with the regular hybrid (as they are the bulk of non-PHEV cars available in the database where I got the
                data from). In RAV4's case though there is quite a substantial difference in horsepower between the PHEV
                and the non-PHEV vehicles, with some 30% more hp in the PHEV variant, so this might mess the results a
                bit perhaps.</p>

            <p class="no-para"><em>Toyota RAV4 - gasoline (hybrid engine, non-plug-in)</em></p>
            <p class="no-para">Since the Plug-in version of the RAV4 is a 4-wheel drive car, I also took into account
                only
                the AWD versions of the regular hybrid RAV4 to even the field a bit.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Average gasoline consumption: 6,3 l/100 km (as per calculation (1) translates to: 6.3 * 2300 / 100 =
                    <strong> 144.9 g CO<sub>2</sub>/km</strong>)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this case again, if you charge your RAV4 Plug-in from a well that has a carbon footprint equal to the
                world's average, there is no difference between the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the Plug-in and the
                regular hybrid car (147 vs 145 g CO<sub>2</sub>/km; sidenote: the plug-in's consumption does not seem to
                be penalized by the fact that it has more horsepower). If the Plug-in gets its electricity from a low
                carbon intensitiy source, then the emission savings are substantial (33%, 100 vs 145 g
                CO<sub>2</sub>/km).</p>
            <h2>Sorta conclusion</h2>
            <p>For a proper analysis more cars would be needed (maybe will be added at a later date), but it would seem
                that driving plug-ins somewhere where the carbon intensity of the power network from which the car gets
                its charge is equal to the world's average electricity generation carbon intensity, then the plug-in
                offers no savings in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions compared to same/similar car that is not a
                plug-in. You might still save money though, if the electricity is cheap, but this is another topic, not
                touched here.</p>
            <p>So if you care about CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and are considering buying a plug-in, it perhaps pays to
                get to know in advance what is the electricity generation carbon footprint in the network where you will
                be getting your charge from.</p>
