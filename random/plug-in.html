        <h1>Plug-in, yes or no (emissions-wise)</h1>
        <p>Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (or PHEVs, or simply plug-ins) are a proposition for how a vehicle owner can
            cut back on CO2 emissions from their driving. But just how good are they at this task? If used correctly,
            they sure (or probably) can bring savings in terms of money spent for fuel for their owners, but even though
            this aspect is very important, I view the mission to cut back emissions as the primary angle from which they
            should be looked at. After all, isn&apos;t electrification of road traffic and promotion of electric
            vehicles (of which PHEVs are a subgroup) mainly aimed at reducing CO2 emissions from road transport, as part
            of wider climate-related actions?</p>
        <p>Out of curiosity and just for the heck of it I set out to make an analysis of sorts to see how they
            compare, in terms of CO2 emissions only. In this text, costs (money savings, â€¦) won&apos;t be a factor and
            concern at all, only CO2 emissions will.</p>
        <p>CO2 emissions from plug-ins come from 3 directions: (1) from fossil fuel burned in the combustion engine
            component of the plug-in drive system, (2) from CO2 footprint of electricity generation (characteristic of
            the
            power network into which a plug-in is, well, plugged-in to charge the battery for the electric motor
            component of its drive system) and (3) the emissions created during the production of the plug-in&apos;s
            traction battery (most often than not a lithium ion battery) and then amortized during the battery&apos;s
            lifetime (for the purpose of this text, 250,000 km driven by the vehicle).</p>
        <p>To calculate these we need to know:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the fossil fuel consumption (in this text expressed in liters/100 km) of a vehicle,</li>
            <li>the electricity consumption (in kWh/100 km) of same vehicle plus the carbon intensity of electricity
                production of the network from which the plug-in gets its charge, and</li>
            <li>an estimation of the CO2 that was emitted during the whole process of mining the necessary resources and
                then producing the vehicle&apos;s traction battery.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In order to see how fit are plug-ins for their task, I will compare the performance of a
            plug-in (emissions-wise, that is) to the relevant values of its sibling that comes equipped with an internal
            combustion engine (ICE) only.</p>
        <h2>Calculations</h2>
        <p>CO2 emissions are expressed in g CO2 per km driven. Here's how to calculate them:</p>
        <p>(1) CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burned:<br>
            Average consumption (in l/100 km) * 2300 (gasoline engines produce 2300 g of CO2 per litre of gasoline
            consumed; for diesel fuel, use 2680 instead of 2300 here) / 100 (to express the value per km instead of per
            100 kms)</p>
        <p>(2) CO2 emissions from electricity consumption<br>
            Average consumption (in kWh/100 km) * CO2 emission from electricity generation, characteristic for the
            network from which the plug-in gets its glow juice from (in g CO2/kWh of electricity produced) / 100
            (to express the value per km instead of per 100 kms)<br>
            The values for emissions from electricity generation vary a lot, for the purpose of this text the following
            reference values will be used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World average: 440 g CO2/kWh of electricity produced<sup>2</sup></li>
            <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France: 79 g CO2/kWh<sup>3</sup>></li>
            <li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photovoltaics (PV) on roof: 40 g CO2/kWh<sup>4</sup>></li>
        </ul>
        <p>(3) CO2 emissions related to lithium battery<br>
            Vehicle&apos;s battery size (in kWh) * g CO2 emitted to produce 1 kWh of lithium battery<sup>1</sup> /
            250.000 (to get a value of g CO2 due to battery production per each km driven by the vehicle during its
            lifetime, which in this text is, rather arbitrarily, set to 250k km)</p>
        <p>To get the CO2 emissions for the vehicle, the 3 components have to be summed!</p>
        <h2>Data rules</h2>
        <p>Data about vehicle consumption were gathered from a popular site where users log their real-world consumption
            data and then averaged; cars year of make 2018 or newer; at least 10,000 km of logged data; ideally the same
            amount of kms logged for gasoline and for electricity consumption and ideally at least one full year of
            data.
            After sorting, the top and bottom 5% of sorted vehicles scrapped to avoid extreme values. For the average
            consumptions for diesel and gasoline only cars I took the mean value between the average consumprion of all
            cars and the consumption of the median car, just in case the average is perhaps distorted due to any
            extreme value on any of the extremes. I am not a data scientist in any way so this list of requirements
            might not be ideal/necessary/logical, but it is the one I used.</p>
        <h2>Carz analysis</h2>
        <h3>Volkswagen passat</h3>
        <p>A VW passat is very handy for this comparison, as you can get it in diesel, gasoline engine only and plug-in
            versions and they put a similar number of hp on the road.</p>
        <p class="no-para"><em>Plug-in (VW passat GTE)</em></p>
        <ul class="no-para">
            <li>Average gasoline consumption: 4.0 l/100 km (which per calculation (1) translates to: 4 * 2300 / 100 =
                92.0 g
                CO2 emitted per each km driven)</li>
            <li>Average electricity consumption: 11.5 kWh/100 km (depending on electricity source, translates to 4.6 to
                50.6 g
                CO2/km)</li>
            <li>Battery capacity: 13 kWh (as per calculation (3) translates to: 13 * 130,000 / 250,000 = 6.8 g CO2/km)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Add the 3 together and the plug-in passat comes in at <strong>103 to 149 g CO2/km</strong>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Average gasoline consumption: 7,1 l/100 km (as per calculation (1) translates to: 7.1 * 2300 / 100 =
                <strong>

        </ul>
        <p>So, if you charge a passat GTE PHEV in an average corner of the world (in the sense of carbon intensity of
            electricity generation) and then you go around driving it rather averagely, your car's CO2 emissions would
            be very much in line with a diesel passat (149 vs 155 g CO2) and less than 10% below the value for a
            gasoline powered, ICE only passat (163 g CO2).<br>
            If you would drive the same plug-in across India, South Africa, Indonesia or Poland, where the carbon
            intensity of electricity generation is above world's average<sup>2</sup>, then your emissions would come
            out at at least 170 g CO2/km, so above the average value for the version of the same car that comes equipped
            solely with an internal combustion engine runing on gasoline. In such places, at least from the
            perspective of curbing CO2 emissions, driving a plug-in is akin to what David Bowie sings in one of his
            songs ... &quot;putting out the fire with gasoline.&quot;<br>
            If you happen to live in a part of the world where carbon intensity of electricity generation is low though,
            like France, Norway, New Zealand, Uruguay<sup>2</sup>, or you mainly fill your car from a PV installation,
            then the CO2 emissions savings you get (compared to same car that is powered solely by an ICE) can be around
            33%, provided, of course, you regularely fill your car with electricity.
